Sandstorm images are often plagued by color distortions, reduced contrast, and blurred details, posing challenges for advanced vision tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel Color-guided Spatial-Frequency Fusion Network (CSF) for sandstorm image enhancement. The CSF framework comprises a Color Guided Module (CGM) for correcting color distortions and a Dual-domain Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) that integrates spatial and frequency domain features. CGM dynamically adjusts color information across RGB channels, facilitating preliminary color correction. DFFM extracts multi-scale spatial features and global frequency components, enabling the network to learn robust and discriminative representations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world sandstorm datasets demonstrate that CSF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative performance, highlighting its effectiveness for enhancing sandstorm images. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.
